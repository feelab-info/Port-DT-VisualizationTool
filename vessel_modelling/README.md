# Vessel Modelling

## Overview

This project focuses on vessel energy consumption analysis and visualization. It includes scripts to process ship energy data, find the closest matching ship based on energy characteristics, and generate energy consumption graphs.

## Features

#### Identify the closest ship based on energy profiles.

#### Analyze energy consumption over a given time slice.

#### Generate and visualize energy consumption graphs.

## Installation

### Prerequisites

Required dependencies (install via pip)

## Setup

#### Clone the repository:

git clone https://github.com/feelab-info/vessel_modelling.git

cd vessel_modelling

## Install dependencies:

pip install -r requirements.txt

## Usage

Run the main script to analyze a specific ship:

python main.py

Modify main.py to specify the target ship, arrival and departure times.
