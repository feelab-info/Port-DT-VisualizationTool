# Frontend Authentication Update

## Overview

The frontend has been updated to handle the new email verification system. Users now need to verify their email addresses before they can access the system.

## New User Flow

### 1. Initial Login Attempt
- User enters email and name
- If email is not verified, they're redirected to registration

### 2. Registration Process
- User fills out registration form
- System sends verification code to their email
- In development mode, code is logged to backend console

### 3. Email Verification
- User enters 6-digit verification code
- Code has 15-minute expiration
- Auto-submission when all digits are entered
- Resend functionality with 60-second cooldown

### 4. Successful Login
- After verification, user can login normally
- System remembers verified status

## Updated Components

### `AuthService.ts`
- Added `register()` method
- Added `verifyEmail()` method  
- Added `resendVerificationCode()` method
- Updated response types with verification properties

### `AuthContext.tsx`
- Updated login return type to include verification status
- Passes through verification-related properties

### `LoginForm.tsx`
- Multi-step authentication flow
- Integrates registration and verification components
- Handles transitions between steps

### `RegistrationForm.tsx` (New)
- User registration with email and name
- Form validation and error handling
- Integration with backend registration API

### `EmailVerificationForm.tsx` (New)
- 6-digit code input with auto-focus
- Resend functionality with cooldown timer
- Paste support for verification codes
- Success/error state management

## Key Features

### User Experience
- ✅ Seamless flow between login, registration, and verification
- ✅ Auto-focus between code input fields
- ✅ Paste support for verification codes
- ✅ Real-time validation and error messages
- ✅ Visual feedback for all states

### Security

- ✅ 6-digit numeric codes only
- ✅ 15-minute code expiration
- ✅ Rate limiting (60-second resend cooldown)
- ✅ Automatic code invalidation after use

### Development Experience
- ✅ Works without email configuration (codes logged to console)
- ✅ TypeScript support throughout
- ✅ Consistent error handling
- ✅ Responsive design

## Using the System

### For Development
1. Start the backend with `npm run dev`
2. Start the frontend with `npm run dev`
3. Try to login - you'll be guided through registration
4. Check backend console for verification codes
5. Enter the code to complete verification

### For Production
1. Configure email settings in backend `.env`:
   ```bash
   SMTP_HOST=smtp.gmail.com
   SMTP_PORT=587
   SMTP_USER=your-email@gmail.com
   SMTP_PASS=your-app-password
   ```
2. Users will receive actual verification emails
3. Same flow but with real email delivery

## Error Handling

The system handles various error scenarios:
- Invalid email formats
- Unauthorized domains
- Expired verification codes
- Network connectivity issues
- Rate limiting violations
- Used verification codes

All errors provide clear, user-friendly messages with guidance on next steps.

## Backwards Compatibility

- Existing authentication still works
- New users are guided through verification
- Unverified users get clear instructions
- No breaking changes to existing API calls

The system is designed to be secure by default while providing a smooth user experience for both development and production environments.
